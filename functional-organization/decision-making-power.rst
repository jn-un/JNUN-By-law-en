Workflow
=======
Workflow has joint decision-making power, also known as execution power. It is an intelligent system, that is, a decentralized framework. As a middle way to establish a key part of the connection between the board of directors and the board of supervisors and its affiliates, the decision-making power does not belong to Any subject and functional department, he is deployed in the decentralized network.

The workflow is run through proposals, and the current decision-making power and its execution power are combined to implement a decentralized workflow based on the consensus made by the board of directors, the board of supervisors and their subordinate organizations.

The relevant basic ecology and decision-making rights, execution rights, immunity rights, editing rights, task distribution, etc. under the decentralized framework are jointly maintained by the board of directors and the board of supervisors, and finally implemented through the board of directors according to the decentralized workflow.

Decentralized Workflow
--------------
Decentralized workflow is the main connection point for establishing the ecology of the board of directors and the board of supervisors. It is a kind of message given by the community proposal uploaded to the intelligent system. Most of them are task distribution, and are distributed to the execution framework and the execution framework through various types of proposals. Oversee the guidance framework to ensure the implementation of community proposals.

Decentralized decision flow
--------------
Decentralized decision-making flow is processed through meeting-type proposal documents, and is an open decision-making process that is executed according to the supervisory board with reference to the current articles of association and the corresponding proposals of the board of supervisors, and the final message is given.
