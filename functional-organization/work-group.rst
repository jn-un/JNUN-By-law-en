Work group
=========
The working group is a specific executive body under the joint current council, and it is given specific subjects and authority by decentralizing the decision-making flow. The working group is its concrete subordinate in the culture and communication council and the science and technology council. The agency is an indispensable force in the implementation and maintenance of the key steps of the proposal implementation in the functional agency. The main work of the working group is to maintain the implementation of specific proposals or engineering plans to promote the implementation of proposals.

Creation of the working group
--------------
The creation of the working group needs to be handled through a decentralized decision-making process. It is part of the framework of the joint current decentralized decision-making process. It is necessary to select a specific council and create it according to existing proposals or engineering plans. In order to become the implementing agency under the council, it is subject to the functions entrusted by the council. After the creation of the work is completed, it cannot be disbanded, and only subsequent changes to the implementation of its proposals can be made.

Changes to working groups
----------------
Changes to working groups need to be handled through a decentralized decision-making process, that is, changes to existing implementation proposals or engineering plans to ensure that implementation of a proposal or engineering plan is not abandoned.
