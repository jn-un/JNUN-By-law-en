Proposal ID
-------------
The proposal number is an extension of the proposal type. The joint proposal number is usually composed of the type abbreviation plus the year in the time (take the last two digits) and the month as the chronological index and plus the sub number. The final combination is: ``[type][year[day]][superposition]``.

Sub number
-------
The proposal number is usually divided into a first-level number and a second-level number. If the second-level number index is not incorporated into the number, the default is the first-level number. Second-level numbering is often used as an extension of first-level numbering, with numbers assigned to individual questions to help differentiate information.

The sub-number needs to be applied according to the proposal, and finally the income from the JNUN File numbering system in the decentralized workflow can be used as a sub-number. Each subnumber occupies a grid.

That is, "``[alphabet]``" subnumbers can be added to a number to identify the file type, and the final combination is: ``[type][year[day]][superposition].[alphabet]...`` .
